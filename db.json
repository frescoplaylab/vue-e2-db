      "post": "Vue is famous for its intuitive design and shallow learning curve. This means itâ€™s easy to train staff in, even non-frontend devs and designers.Since developers will be up-and-running with Vue quickly, training costs will be kept to a minimum.Vue provides a powerful solution for complex single-page applications but also scales down nicely for smaller projects where only basic page functionality needs to be added.",

In fact, it has become so much a part of people's lives that you can learn their life story just by checking their page. Their friends, likes and dislikes, relationship status, phone number, address, everything. Sounds a little dangerous. There are positive and negative effects that Facebook has on people, and they can be quite significant",
